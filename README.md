### affirmation generator

The affirmation generator was created as a a part of #365Affirmations, which is a project to collect at least 365 positive affirmations by September 2016.

Users can visit this site to view the collection thus far - a quote is randomly generated each visit or when the next button is pushed.
There is a .php form integrated into the site in order to allow users to submit their own quotes to add to the collection.

The live website can be viewed at: http://www.carefreecollective.com/affirmation_generator/


There is not yet a live link available for the Flask application that connects to the quote database and generated dynamic links but the code is available here:
- affirmation_flask.py
- templates
  - author_lookup.html
- AffirmationDatabaseGenerator.ipynb
