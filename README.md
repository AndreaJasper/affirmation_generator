### affirmation generator

The affirmation generator was created as a a part of #365Affirmations, which is a project to collect at least 365 positive affirmations by September 2016.

Users can visit this site to view the collection thus far - a quote is randomly generated each visit or when the next button is pushed.
There is a .php form integrated into the site in order to allow users to submit their own quotes to add to the collection.

The live website can be viewed at: http://www.carefreecollective.com/affirmation_generator/


There is not yet a live link available for the Flask Web application of this project which connects to the quote database and generates dynamic URLs for each author in the collection but the code is available here:
- affirmation_flask.py
- templates
  - author_lookup.html
- AffirmationDatabaseGenerator.ipynb
