### affirmation generator 

The affirmation generator was created as a a part of #365Affirmations, which is a project to collect at least 365 positive affirmations by September 2016.

Users can visit this site to view the collection thus far - a quote is randomly generated each visit or when the next button is pushed. 
There is a .php form integrated into the site in order to allow users to submit their own quotes to add to the collection.
